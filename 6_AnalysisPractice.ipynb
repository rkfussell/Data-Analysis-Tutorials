    "This exercise aims to remind you or familiarize you with some quantitative analysis tools that will be useful in this course. Please refer to the Statistics Summary on Canvas for guidance or check in with your TA or teammates for help. These questions refer to the data in the table, which we will assume were collected previously from an experiment where the researchers expected that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ was modeled as $y=8x-5$.\n",

    "First, we will check whether the measurements of $y$ at $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ are distinguishable within uncertainties. To do this, we use the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t^\\prime = \\frac{\\left|A - B\\right|}{\\sqrt{\\delta A^2 + \\delta B^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which takes the difference between the two measurement values ($A$ and $B$) divided by the square root of the combined uncertainties (where $\\delta A$ is the uncertainty in $A$ and $\\delta B$ is the uncertainty in $B$). We combine the uncertainties by adding them *in quadrature* (i.e., we add the square of each uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two sets of measurements of the same physical phenomenon, we would expect the means to be within one unit of uncertainty of eachother 68% of the time.  Therefore, we would expect to see a t' value of approximately 1 on average.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating $t'$ for two measurements, you can evaluate their disimilarity (or distinguishability) through the following interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $t'\\approx1$  If we have two sets of measurements and a t' value of approximately 1, then the sets are indistinguishible and they may represent the same physical phenomenon.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  $t'<<1$  If we have a t' value of much less than 1, then it is possible that either we overestimated our uncertainties, or that our current level of precision is not good enough for the phenomenon that we are trying to measure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  $1\\lesssim t'<3$  This is a grey area.  It is still possible that our two sets of measurements are coming from the same phenomenon, but it is less likely than if our t' is somewhere close to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  $t' >3$ If our t' is greater than 3, then it is unlikely that our two sets of measurements were measuring the same phenomena.  This means that we have distinguished between two sets of physical phenomena.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: $|t'| \\le 1$ **does not** mean that A and B are the same. It only tells us that, we cannot distinguish them with the given data. For example, if you do a better measurement and decrease the uncertainties, you might later uncover a difference between A and B. That is, poor precision may be hiding a subtle difference!"
