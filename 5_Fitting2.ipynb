    "\n",
    "Before, we were looking for the values of the slope and intercept that gave us the smallest $\\chi^2$ given the data. This sounds like a minimization problem! We want the computer to do what you were doing with the sliders in the manual fitting task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For linear fits, we can use simple derivatives to find the values of the slope and intercept that minimize the $\\chi^2$. (For a derivation of these expressions, see J.R. Taylor, \"An Introduction to Error Analysis\", Section 8.2.)\n",
