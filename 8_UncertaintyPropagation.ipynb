    "In the second case, we say that the uncertainty from the single measurement is *propagated* (i.e., transmitted) through each single line that makes up the full distance. This process is similar to what we found with the period of a pendulum measurement: if you measure the time for a single period and conduct 10 repeated trials, the uncertainty from starting and stopping the stopwatch is repeated (compounded) each time. Whereas, if you measure the time for 10 swings of the pendulum, the uncertainty from starting and stopping the stopwatch only happens once.\n",
