    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use python code primarily to analyze our data in the lab. We often will use the same data for multiple analyses, so it is useful to store data or numbers in a variable, which we can easily refer to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store variables in a letter or word using this symbol: <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>=</span> (called the <span style='color:Red'>assignment operator</span>). Variable names can be any combination of letters and numbers, like <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>hello</span> or <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>abcd1</span> or <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>m4n5</span>. Variable names cannot start with a number, cannot contain spaces or special characters, and cannot use a reserved word (If a word turns green when you type it, it is reserved. For example, <span style= 'font-family:Courier; color:Green'>print</span> is reserved.) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "To store the number <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>3</span> in the variable name <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>a</span>, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style= 'font-family:Courier'>a = 3</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this in your head, read it as: <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>a</span> is assigned the value <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>3</span>. Typing <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>3 = a</span> would fail because it would try to store the value <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>a</span> in the invalid variable name <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>3</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style= 'font-family:Courier'>3 = a</span> is equivalent in math class, but in code the variable name must be on the left. Saying \"3 is assigned the value <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>a</span>\" doesn't make much sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also store a phrase (or a *string*, which is a list of characters or anything that can be pressed on a keyboard, used largely to represent text) in a variable if you put it in quotes. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style= 'font-family:Courier'>my_phrase = \"your phrase here\"</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget the quotes, you will get an error, because it is not valid to store a string (or phrase) without quotes in a variable. In general, you can store strings in a variable but cannot store a variable in a string\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q2, you used the function <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>print()</span> to display this text: <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>hello world</span>. You can also use the function <span style= 'font-family:Courier'>print()</span> to display the information stored in a variable by putting the variable inside the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
