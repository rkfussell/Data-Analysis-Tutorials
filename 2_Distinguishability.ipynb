On average, we would expect to see 68% of our measurements falling within one standard deviation of the mean.  If we take many such sets of measurements, we would expect the mean of each set to fall within one uncertainty of the mean 68% of the time.  \n",

It is also possible we are measuring the same phenomena, however, even if we are measuring the same phenomena when we take two different data sets, we would still expect to see some difference in the means of two different data sets.  For example, if we take several measurements of the period of a pendulum when released from 10 degrees, and several more measurements of the period at 20 degrees, we need a method to know if the average period is the same (and therefore we are measuring the same physical phenomenon) or different when released from the two angles.

    "\n",
    "3.  $1\\lesssim t'<3$  This is a grey area.  It is still possible that our two sets of measurements are coming from the same phenomenon, but it is less likely than if our t' is somewhere close to 1. \n",
    "\n",
